# Version_Control_Repository_Assignment
This is a demonstration of using version control software. Creating a local repositroy then pushing this up to GitHub. Chanes were made to all files within their own branches. Then the Cats, Dogs and Rabbit branches were merged with the master branch. 

Now that I have made a change I am going to pull this change into the local repository
